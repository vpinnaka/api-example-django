# Features to be implemented

### Doctor Dashboard
- [x] the doctor should see an interactive page page they can leave open that displays today’s appointments, 
- [x] indicating which patients are scheduled, 
- [x] which patients have checked in, 
- [x] how long they have been waiting. 
- [x] the doctor can indicate they are seeing a patient, which stops the “time spent waiting” clock. 
- [x] It should be able to update when an appointment status changes or a new appointment is scheduled by the receptionist or patient. 
- [x] It should also display some summary statistics, like the overall average wait time for all patients they have ever seen.
